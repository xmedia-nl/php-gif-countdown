# PHP-GIF-Countdown

A countdown based gif clock ideal for emails and websites.

## UPDATED 10-2024 FOR USE WITH PHP 8.2


## HOW TO USE

1. Upload the files to your server.
2. Visit the gif.php file in your browser with ?time=DD-MM-YYYY HH:MM:SS appended to the URL.
3. The gif will countdown to the time you specified.

Time can be left out to default to 00:00:00 on the set date.


## Customisation

Changes need to be made in the gif.php file for now. I might make this more user friendly in the future and change that to query string parameters.
